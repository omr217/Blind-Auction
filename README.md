# Secret Auction Program 💰

-

This is a simple command-line **auction program** written in Python. It allows multiple users to enter their bids, keeps them secret from other users, and then determines the highest bidder.

-

## 📦 Features

- Takes input from multiple users for bidding.
- Clears the console after each bid (using `replit.clear()` for a clean interface).
- Identifies and announces the highest bidder.

-

### 🚀 How It Works

1. The program prompts each participant for their **name** and **bid**.
2. After entering a bid, the screen clears to keep the bids private.
3. Once no more bidders remain, it announces the **winner with the highest bid**.

-

#### 📝 Usage

Run the script and follow the prompts. Each user should take turns entering their bid, ensuring fairness and privacy during the auction.
